In the previous video, we explored the simplicity of creating and running a basic Svelte application. Now, let's delve into the files and folders generated by the project and understand how the control flow works when running the application.

### Project Structure Overview

Upon opening the project in VS Code, we can observe four folders and five files at the root level. Let's break down the essential components.

#### Files

- package.json:

  - This file contains dependencies and scripts for the project. Notably, Svelte version 3 is listed as a dev dependency, and Rollup, a module bundler, is used to transform Svelte code into JavaScript for browsers.
    ```
    "devDependencies": {
        "svelte": "^3.0.0",
        "rollup": "^2.0.0",
        // ...
    },
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "rollup -c -w",
        "build": "rollup -c",
        "start": "serve public",
        // ...
    }
    ```

* rollup.config.js:

      * This is the configuration file for Rollup, used when running yarn dev or yarn build. It defines various configurations for the build process.

* yarn.lock (or package-lock.json):

      * Lock files ensure consistent dependency installations. They're generated based on whether you use Yarn or npm.

* .gitignore:

      * This file specifies files and folders to be ignored by Git.

* README.md:

  - A readme file with information about the project.

#### Folders

- node_modules:

      * Contains all installed dependencies. Generated when running `yarn` or `npm install`.

* public:

      * Holds static assets for publication. Includes a favicon, global CSS file, and the primary index.html file.

* scripts:

  - Contains TypeScript setup files. For this tutorial, we focus on JavaScript, so you can ignore this folder.

* src (source):

  - The most crucial folder during development. It contains the starting point for the Svelte application, the `main.js` file, and the main component, `App.svelte`.

### Control Flow Explained

#### main.js

The `main.js` file in the `src` folder is the starting point for our Svelte application. It imports the root component (`App.svelte`) and renders it within the body of the HTML document.

```
// main.js
import App from './App.svelte';

const app = new App({
  target: document.body,
});

export default app;
```

#### App.svelte

The `App.svelte` file represents the UI of our application. It consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file, denoted by the `.svelte` extension.

```
<!-- App.svelte -->
<script>
  let name = 'world';
</script>

<main>
  <h1>Hello {name}</h1>
  <p>This is a Svelte application!</p>
</main>

<style>
  main {
    text-align: center;
    margin: 1em;
    padding: 1em;
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
    border-radius: 0.5em;
  }
</style>
```

#### Running the Application

When you run `yarn dev` in the terminal, the following sequence occurs:

- index.html:

  - Served in the browser and contains a reference to bundle.js.

- bundle.js:

  - Represents the compiled main.js file. It is the JavaScript code that the browser can understand.

- main.js:

  - Renders the Svelte code within the body tag.

- App.svelte:

  - Defines the UI components and logic for the application.

This control flow ensures that your Svelte application is displayed correctly in the browser.

In the next blog post, we'll explore the intriguing `.svelte` file extension and understand its significance in Svelte development.
