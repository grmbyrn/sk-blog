In this Svelte series, we'll start from the ground up and dive into various concepts in Svelte. In this introductory post, I'll give you a brief overview of what Svelte is, why it's worth your attention, and the prerequisites you need to get started.

### What is Svelte?

Let's start with the basics. What is Svelte? Svelte is a powerful component framework designed for building high-performance web applications. Now, what sets it apart is its declarative approach to coding.

### Declarative Coding with Svelte:

Unlike imperative programming models (think C or C++), where you explicitly list down each step, Svelte allows you to declare what outcome you want. You simply tell Svelte what you want your UI to look like, and it takes care of the rest. This makes code more readable, writable, and eliminates code duplication.

So, to sum it up, Svelte is a component framework that enables you to build web applications in a declarative manner.

### Why Svelte?

Now that we know what Svelte is, let's explore why you should consider using it over other frameworks like React or Vue.

Compiled Step Advantage:

Unlike React or Vue, Svelte shifts much of the work into a compiled step that occurs during the build process. This means no need to bundle the framework code, resulting in a smaller bundle size. While this happens behind the scenes, it significantly impacts the developer experience.

### What is Svelte?

- Svelte simplifies state management with Svelte Stores right out of the box. Unlike other frameworks that may leave you pondering over options like Redux or Vuex, Svelte provides straightforward solutions.

* Additionally, Svelte comes with a plethora of features that address common challenges in web development, such as adding motion and element transitions, handling user input via form elements, and managing CSS without global pollution.

* The bottom line is that Svelte streamlines your development process, making it easier to make decisions and progress in web development.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into Svelte, ensure you have a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals. Knowledge of modern JavaScript (ES6 and beyond) is essential, and while you don't need to be an expert, familiarity with modern features will enhance your Svelte coding experience.

If you're not yet comfortable with modern JavaScript, check out [this video](link to your video on modern JavaScript features) where I cover 10 features that will prepare you for Svelte.

### Let's Get Started!

With these fundamentals in place, we're ready to embark on our Svelte journey. In the next video, we'll build a simple "Hello World" application to get hands-on experience.
